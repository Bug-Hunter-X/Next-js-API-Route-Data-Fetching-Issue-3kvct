# Next.js API Route Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when fetching data from an API route in a Next.js application.  The `MyComponent` does not render the fetched data, instead showing a loading indicator indefinitely.  This is a simplified example to illustrate the problem and its solution.

## Problem

The `MyComponent` component fetches data from the `/api/data` route. However, even after the data is successfully fetched, the component continues to display the "Loading..." message. This occurs because of the way the `useEffect` hook and asynchronous operations interact, specifically in how the `data` state update is handled.

## Solution

The solution involves optimizing the data fetching and rendering logic to ensure the component correctly updates with the fetched data.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
